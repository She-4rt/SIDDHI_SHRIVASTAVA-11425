Menu-Driven Scientific Calculator (C Programming Mini Project)

This project is a Menu-Driven Scientific Calculator implemented in C. It allows users to perform a wide range of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), modulus, exponentiation, and other scientific calculations, all through a simple, interactive menu interface.

Key Features:

Easy-to-navigate menu for selecting operations.

Modular design using separate functions for each calculation.

Input validation and error handling for robust performance.

Continuous operation until the user chooses to exit.

This project demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts like functions, loops, conditional statements, and modular programming, making it an ideal learning tool for beginners.
